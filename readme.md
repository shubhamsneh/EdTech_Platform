## Introduction

Learnify is a course recommendation platform that enables users to input learning preferences, budget constraints, and weekly time commitments. Leveraging AI and data science, the platform generates a master courseâ€”a curated set of courses tailored to the user's objectives. The technology stack includes Angular for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, Python and Flask for AI/data science, and PostgreSQL as the database. Docker is employed for seamless deployment and scaling, with optional Kubernetes support.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Angular CLI
- Python
- Flask
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (optional)
- Kubernetes (optional)

### Local Setup

1. **Install frontend and backend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd client
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../server
   npm install

2. **Install Python Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have the required Python dependencies installed for the AI/model component:

    ```bash
    # Install Python dependencies
    cd ../model
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Create a .env file in the server folder with the following content:**

    ```bash
    MODEL_API=<model api>
    POSTGRESQL_DB_HOST = <host>
    POSTGRESQL_DB_USER = <username>
    POSTGRESQL_DB_PASSWORD = <password>
    POSTGRESQL_DB = <database name>


4. **Create an environment.ts file in the client/src/environments folder with the following content:**

    ```bash
    export const environment = {
    production: false,
    apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000', // Adjust if necessary
    };

5. **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    node index

6. **In a separate terminal, start the Angular frontend:**
